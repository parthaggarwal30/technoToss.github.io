  <p>Whether a new data science team or an experienced one. We have created a top 31 list of points to help ensure your team succeeds on its projects and processes it puts in place. As data scientists we want to spend more of our time analyzing problems and less time dealing with corporate politics. How can we do that when there is often a rift between executives and their data science teams. This can sometimes lead to a lack of trust, poor implementation and support of projects and thus,failed data science teams.</p>   
  <ul>
  <li><h3>Get Executive Ownership</h3>
  <p>One of the key contributing factors for any project is getting executive buy in. It is your job as a data science program manager, project manager or data scientist, to get your executives to believe in your project. Without their ownership, and funding, your project will not go on. When executives see that your data science project will help drive their strategy.They will be all in.</p></li>
  
  <li><h3>Be bold, tell your manager they are wrong…with data</h3>
    <p>Managers and executives are humans, they can only process so much information at once and see so many correlations. You, as a data scientist have access to the know how and tools to process 100x that amount of data and accurately look at thousands of correlations. Use that knowledge and boldly show your manager they are wrong. No, we don’t mean be a dick about it.We mean, support your manager.Help him or her go into meetings with the right conclusions.They will thank you for it.However,this requires you tell them they are wrong.</p></li> 
    <li> <h3>Successfully implement a simple project first</h3> 
        <p>Look we get it, everyone wants to develop the next Google or Facebook algorithm. Why not, they are cool, super powerful and rack up billions of dollars a year. However, if your team is just starting out and you want them to succeed start small. Don’t worry, even something simple, if done well can provide your executives with insurmountable value. Once you get that first win under your belt. Executives will be begging you to help them on everything. Then you will have to work on making sure your projects are bombarded by requests all the time, or at least, only the right projects are being worked on.</p></li>               
          
    <li><h3>Communicate the internal and external values of data science to management</h3>
    <p>Data science has the ability to affect customers and employees. Tell your managers how it will work and its value. This point is somewhat repeated through this list. However, the more angles you can communicate to management that your project is going to save money, the better. Data scientists love to talk about how their algorithms are calculating the probability a person is scratching their nose when they are scrolling through Facebook. However, the business teams only care how much money they can make from that knowledge. Otherwise…why?</p></li>      

   <li><h3> Be Positive!</h3><p>Corny, but true. It is really easy, especially if you are a data science project manager, to lose hope. Maybe the insights your team has come back with are not very valuable or maybe they haven’t found anything at all. Guess what, that is much more common than you think. Not every project will lead to instant success. Be patient and be positive. If your data is clean, and your data science practices are solid. Something will eventually shake out.</p></li>
